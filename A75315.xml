            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">B</seg>Efore the <hi>Norman</hi> Conque≈øt, the <hi>French</hi> looked long upon the affaires of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> with a greedy eye, and in tho≈øe innocent times maintained a partie here in <hi>England</hi> to make good their Faction. The <hi>Spaniards,</hi> as they are more grave in their deportment, ≈øo they are more retired in their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øailes; and being then alwayes in Warres, either to e≈øtabli≈øh or increa≈øe their more VVe≈øterne territories, had hardly the lei≈øure to think on <hi>England,</hi> untill the Allyance of King <hi>Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lip</hi> with Queen <hi>Mary;</hi> ≈øince which time, being taken either with the wealth or the plea≈øure of this I≈øle, they have alwaies either openly by warre, or privately by policie, been indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrious either to a≈ø≈øault it or betray it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="tcp:118555:3"/>I will not wipe off the du≈øt of antiquity from the ≈øtory of the French, to repre≈øent unto you, what were the de≈øignes which many yeares ≈øince they nouri≈øhed to unite this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome unto France, neither will I ravell out your expectation or the time in any di≈øcour≈øe upon the Spaniard more then what ≈øhall concern our pre≈øent purpo≈øe, which is to declare unto you, how the French and Spani≈øh for the≈øe late yeares have de≈øperately conjoyned into one re≈øolve of mi≈øchiefe for the ≈øubverting of the Prote≈øtant Religion, and the ruin of this Kingdome, which was of late the envy, and is now become the pitty and the a≈øtoni≈øhment of Chri≈øtendome.</p>
            <p>Yet before I arrive unto their latter practi≈øes, on which I chiefly would in≈øi≈øt, it will be worth your ob≈øervation to con≈øider how eagerly both nations did ambiate the marriage of the renowned Queen <hi>Elizabeth,</hi> who alwayes overcame her enemies and her Sex. The fir≈øt who did court her in the way of marriage, was <hi>Don Iohn de Au≈øtria</hi> thinking thereby to reduce our I≈øland and Religion to the Spani≈øh Principles, but the Queen who knew very well before, what was the am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and the arts of Spaine could no wayes bee induced to heare of that illegitimate Prince; The ≈øecond was the Duke of <hi>Alen≈øon</hi> brother to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, then King of France, (a gallant Gentleman indeed) and who, where≈øoever he came did winne upon the hearts of all by his valour and his courte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øie, but as the Kingdome was then ble≈ø≈øed in a brave Queen, ≈øo was the Queen ble≈ø≈øed with as brave a Coun≈øell, and that marriage by rea≈øon of the diver≈øity in religion, and many con≈øiderations of State being al≈øo rejected, the Duke retur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned into Flanders where either by greife or poy≈øon, he died ≈øtrangely in the flower of his Age, of an i≈ø≈øue of blood, which abundantly came from him, out of all the pa≈ø≈øages of his bodie.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="tcp:118555:3"/>In the ≈øame manner al≈øo died his Elder Brother <hi>Charles</hi> the eight King of France, neither did his other brother <hi>Henry</hi> the third, (who before hee was King of France ≈øwayed the Imperiall Scepter of Polonia) de≈øcend unto his grave by a naturall or timely death, ≈øo true is that of the Satyri≈øt.</p>

            <p>Herein you may ob≈øerve how ju≈øt are all the works, and how con≈øtant are the wayes of God, their Father <hi>Henry</hi> the ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of France promi≈øed his Father on his death-bed, that he would make no more warre with the Prote≈øtants, nor be the occa≈øion of any more effu≈øion of blood in France for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, but ≈øoon after his death, forgetting his Covenant with the dead, and overcome with the evill coun≈øell of his Queen, the warre began anew, and the old wounds being opened, the land again did ≈øweat with blood. But marke the event, this <hi>Henry</hi> being afterwards at a Turnament, in which him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelfe would be a tilter, he was ≈øtruck through the eye with the ≈øplinter of a ≈øpeare, of which not long afterwards hee dyed.</p>
            <p>His ≈øonnes <hi>Charles</hi> and <hi>Francis</hi> mi≈øerably ended their contracted dayes by a terrible evacuation of blood, the wit of Iu≈øtice puni≈øhing that blood in their bodies which they had cau≈øed to i≈ø≈øue out of the body of the Kingdom. <hi>Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry</hi> the third a great contriver of that mo≈øt horrid ma≈ø≈øacre, and Author of much Prote≈øtant blood≈øhed at the battels of <hi>Dreux</hi>

and <hi>Moncontour,</hi> was killed afterwards him≈øelfe by a Friar, and both the Murder and the Murderer commended by <hi>Xi≈øtus</hi> then Pope of Rome, neither of ≈øuch faire hopes of po≈øterity was there any one left, of the great and glorious name of <hi>Valois</hi> to ≈øucceed in the Kingdom of France. I have obviou≈øly in≈øerted this, that the world might take notice how deere unto God is the ≈øafety of his people, and that he hath pacified the crying blood of the Prote≈øtants with the de≈øtruction of the families of the Monarchs of the earth. If you would give me the reading of it, I could furni≈øh your ob≈øervation with another ≈øtory, which becau≈øe it is very me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable I will here in≈øert it, and then returne from whence a little I have digre≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Henry</hi> the third being ≈ølaine, the Crowne of France was devolved unto <hi>Henry</hi> of <hi>Burbon</hi> King of <hi>Navarre,</hi> who had married <hi>Margaret</hi> ≈øi≈øter to <hi>Henry</hi> the third, ≈øhe was a Lady of a delicate con≈øtitution both of mind and body, and admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable for her vertues and her vices, who finding that the Peers of France had e≈øtranged their hearts and their loyalties from her husband by rea≈øon of his religion, ≈øhe per≈øwaded him for the a≈ø≈øurance of his Crowne, and the ≈øafety of his per≈øon, to turn Catholick again; which indeed once before he did, which was at the ma≈ø≈øacre of Saint <hi>Bartholomews,</hi> ≈øome 3 or 4 dayes after the ≈øolemnization of his marriage. But though that ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per≈øtition be blind, what cannot the Ie≈øuits ≈øee? They conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that this alteration of his Religion was but di≈ø≈øolation in the King, they corrupted a villain with gold and the certainty of ≈øalvation, (as if the way to heaven was by murder) to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy him; this de≈øperate caitiff (under the pretence of private bu≈øine≈ø≈øe of great importance) having pa≈ø≈øed the guards had acce≈ø≈øe unto his Maje≈øty, and finding him on the top of the ≈øtaires ≈øtooping, and prepared to li≈øten to him, hee ≈øtruck at
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:118555:4"/>
his bre≈øt with his knife, and mi≈ø≈øing it by a more merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>full errour, he ≈øtruck his knife through his lip again≈øt his teeth. The villaine apprehended and the tumult appea≈øed, a great Per≈øonage ≈øtanding neare unto his Maje≈øty, ≈øaid unto him, Sir, <hi>You have denied God in your mouth, and now you feele he hath ≈øtruck you in the mouth, I mu≈øt be≈øeech your Maie≈øty to con≈øider of it, and not deny him in your heart, lea≈øt he ≈øhould ≈øtrike you through the heart.</hi> Many yeares after this were pa≈ø≈øed away, and the King oftentimes in his mirth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt other doubts would de≈øire to bee ≈øatisfied in his knowledge of what Religion he him≈øelfe was, and ≈øurely at the conference betwixt the Cardinall <hi>Du Peron,</hi> and <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øieur Du Ple≈øsis,</hi> it ≈øeems that he was more addicted to the Cardinalls part; how≈øoever not long after (it is too well known,) that pa≈ø≈øing through the ≈øtreet in his <hi>Caroach,</hi> hee was ≈øtruck quite through the heart with <hi>Ravilliacs</hi> knife. The hearts of Princes are in the mercifull hands of God, who by vile Agents can deprive them of their temporall Crownes, to crowne them with glory and happine≈ø≈øe for evermore; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoever this is a true and a ≈øad relation, and of great u≈øe and con≈øequence in all ages, if it preci≈øely be con≈øidered.</p>
            <p>I will not trouble you with a further repetition, how often in Queen <hi>Elizabeths</hi> dayes the Spani≈øh faction by Warre, by Ie≈øuites, and by ≈øome great though di≈øaffected per≈øonages at Court did advance it ≈øelf, and how often it was ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed. VVhat title the Spaniard pretended to the Crowne, even in the evening of her raigne is ≈øufficiently knowne and an≈øwe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red. I will pa≈ø≈øe therefore to the beginning of King <hi>Iames</hi> his dayes, who although hee was a mo≈øt wi≈øe and knowing Prince, the Spani≈øh faction found then a greater power to act their de≈øignes, and Hi≈øtorians a le≈ø≈øer liberty to expre≈ø≈øe them: Almo≈øt at his very entrance into this Kingdome, an

impudent and wilde Petition was contrived by Father <hi>Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net</hi> and other Prie≈øts and Ie≈øuites, for a tolleration of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and preferred to his Maje≈øty, but advi≈øedly rejected, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Arch Bi≈øhop <hi>Abbots</hi> grave coun≈øell to the King; upon this deniall their Faction growing de≈øperate, they enterpri≈øed (by the advice of the ≈øaid Father <hi>Garnet</hi>) the Gunpowder trea≈øon, for which how farre they dived into Hell for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øaile, the Devils them≈øelves can witne≈ø≈øe. Not long before in eighty eight, they practi≈øed on the water to overthrow us, and now (as if they would make all the Elements acce≈ø≈øary to our de≈øtruction) they contrived in the Earth by fire, to blow us up into the Ayre. And indeed it is no wonder they ≈øhould ≈øo much practi≈øe with fire, and be ≈øo guilty of it, who are them≈øelves the fire brands of Hell. One would have thought that ≈øuch a de≈øperate and ≈øo matchle≈ø≈øe a de≈øigne, upon King, Peers, Kingdome and people, ≈øhould have produced the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of ≈øome Law, for the utter extirpation of all Papi≈øts, and their Ie≈øuiticall adherents; but unfortunately ≈øuch was then the intere≈øt with forraign Princes and the King of Spain, the entertainment of who≈øe Pentioners, being ≈øome of our Nobility and Church Papi≈øts, came to no le≈ø≈øe then three thou≈øand or four thou≈øand pound a yeare, that after execution done upon a few, the further pro≈øecution of the Law did cea≈øe; Nay ≈øo prevalent was this Spani≈øh Faction with King <hi>Iames,</hi> that by many impertinent ≈øollicitations, they induced him to condi≈øcend to many things, which have proved ≈øince very prejudiciall to him, his Royall progeny, the Peace of his Kingdome, and the Prote≈øtant Religion then e≈øtabli≈øhed. For in the fir≈øt place, his Maje≈øty was drawne to conclude a Peace with Spain, the mo≈øt di≈øadvantageous to this King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom that ever was; for by it no Engli≈øh were permitted to trade into the We≈øt Indies, and if any did adventure ≈øo to do,

he was to be hanged and tortured without mercy; from hence it came to pa≈ø≈øe, that the Engli≈øh who had re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved with the Netherlands for the ≈øending of ten thou≈øand men between them into tho≈øe parts, were ≈øo deterred as that our friends the Netherlanders were left to ≈øhift for them≈øelves; who now have gotten ≈øo great a footing in Bra≈øile (which is not the tenth part of America, yet big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in ≈øcituation then three times England) that the Spa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niard will never be able to remove them thence. And while the Engli≈øh for many yeares ≈øare ≈øtill, the King of Spain hath beene ≈øo well inabled by the va≈øt trea≈øures that came from thence, to make full and due payment to his Ie≈øuiticall Factors here, as that they ever ≈øince have performed mo≈øt faithfull ≈øervice to him. And le≈øt any thing ≈øhould be wanting to the Catholicke King underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Catholick Cau≈øe, they per≈øwaded King <hi>Iames</hi> to arme the King of Spain with two thou≈øand Peeces of Ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, under colour of which licence, Sir <hi>Iohn Ieme</hi> tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported twice as many, what others did is not well known, but it is conceived by able judgements, that if the King of Spain were as well prepared with men and ≈øhipping, as he is with Guns and Ammunition, he might beat us with our own weapons. And thus from one degree to another, they have ≈øtill incroached on His Maje≈øty. After this, with might and main they laboured for; and cried up his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øe prerogative, a thing which Princes are generally over much delighted to hear, and by this his Maje≈øtie was drawn at la≈øt to di≈øaffect Parliaments, as intrenching too much upon His Royall Prerogative, and regulating the Regall power, which never ought to exceed Law, but when it rendeth to the relief of the ≈øubject in mitigating
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:118555:6"/>
the rigour of it, and not by impoveri≈øhing the Subjects, and oppre≈ø≈øing them with illegall Monopolies and unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable taxations, which by wofull experience this mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerable Kingdome hath too long felt and groaned under the burthen of them.</p>
            <p>Many more particulars may be alledged, as the prevail<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ing power they had with King <hi>Iames,</hi> when (upon the motion of <hi>Gondamore</hi>) his Maje≈øty neglected the proffer of ≈øome German Princes, and condi≈øcended to ≈øend his ≈øon and heir into Spain, for the contract of a marriage with the King of Spains ≈øi≈øter, and one of a contrary Religion, which had it accordingly proceeded, it might have proved as prejudiciall and trouble≈øome, as the marriage with France.</p>
            <p>But the proceedings of the Spani≈øh Faction ≈øince the acce≈ø≈øe of His Maje≈øty that now is unto the Crowne, I need not recite at large, they are all within your owne memory, yet for your better ≈øatisfaction, I cannot but report ≈øome few particulars. The fir≈øt is, of the laying of their foundation at the Conclave at Rome, where it was concluded, that his Holine≈ø≈øe ≈øhould have a Nuntio in England, and the Queen of England ≈øhould have an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent at Rome, to act things here as ≈øhould be there re≈øol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved on. Another was to per≈øwade his Maje≈øty by media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Queen (whom they too well knew and ≈øaw that he entirely loved) to prefer tho≈øe to dignities and Courts of judicature, who might ≈øerve be≈øt to put in execution their mi≈øchievous de≈øignes, whereby it mo≈øt unhappily came to pa≈ø≈øe that the Spani≈øh Faction became the Cabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net Councellors, ≈øo over-awing and over-≈øwaying the greater and better part of the privie Councell, that their
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:118555:6"/>
meer propo≈øals pa≈øt for re≈øolutions, and hence it was that the Starchamber (where the≈øe and they whom the≈øe promoted and countenanced did bear the greate≈øt ≈øway) did abound with extravagant Cen≈øures, no le≈ø≈øe uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcionable then terrible, by oppre≈øsing the common people and maintaining illegall taxations, and inducing Preroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives far beyond the pre≈øidents of all former times, and ≈øurely had it not been for tho≈øe exceeding powerfull Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pi≈øh factors, the high Commi≈øsion had not decreed ≈øo ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly to oppo≈øe true Religion, by Su≈øpen≈øion, deprivation, Excommunication, Fines and impri≈øonment, much le≈ø≈øe ≈øome Bi≈øhops and inferior Eccle≈øia≈øticall Courts, had not adventured with ≈øuch animo≈øity to propo≈øe, or with ≈øuch violence to pro≈øecute their own ≈øuper≈øtitious articles, as if they had bin Canons concluded on by the whole Church of England, or as if the Articles of the≈øe men which con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øted only of Bi≈øhops, Deans, Archdeacons, &amp;c. (as every Bi≈øhop or ≈ølye Officiall thought good) ought to binde the the whole Church being ≈øo partially, if not corruptly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented. For are Cathedral Churches any other but ≈øuch places which Queen <hi>Elizabeth</hi> and her Councell for ≈øome political ends, were plea≈øed to let re≈øt in ≈øome part of that popi≈øh ≈øplendor and magnificence which might take with the neighboring Princes of the contrary Religion, and not render her and her people utterly reconcileable to the Church of Rome. The Parochiall Churches then were better clean≈øed from Popi≈øh Reliques, according to the well ≈øetled con≈øtitution of other reformed Churches, and now for≈øooth better refined Parochiall Churches mu≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain be reduced to a Cathedrall garbe, becau≈øe it is more ceremonious and maje≈øticall, and therein more re≈øembleth Rome.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="tcp:118555:7"/>Thus with the over≈øwelling greatne≈ø≈øe of tho≈øe cabinet Councellours, men were preferred to places of Iudica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in the Common wealth, which (I ≈øuppo≈øe) either could not or would not maintain Iu≈øtice, but were alwaies forced to advance prerogative above and again≈øt Law, the ≈øubiects by many woefull complaints can witne≈ø≈øe how many millions of monies in few yeares have been wre≈øted from them under the name of Lone, Knighthood, Shipmony, &amp;c. all which though unlawfull, yet were they either ju≈øtified by the mo≈øt part of the Iudges, and the people mi≈øerably oppre≈ø≈øed.</p>
            <p>The next plot which they no le≈ø≈øe endeavoured then obtained, was to weaken his Maje≈øty both at home and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, and indeed which way could they weaken him more in England, then to imploy the cabinet coun≈øell to per≈øwade him to make ≈øale of his own proper hereditary land, and ≈øo without Parliaments to rai≈øe mony for the ≈øupporting of his royall dignity by unlawfull and unu≈øuall meanes, which could not but much withdraw the dutifull affection of the ≈øubiect from him, wherein his chiefe≈øt ≈øtrength con≈øi≈øted, and how could they have devi≈øed more to le≈ø≈øen the reputation of his wi≈ødome and pui≈ø≈øance with forraign Princes then by inciting his Maie≈øty (as if hee had married the conditions as well as the daughter of France) to begin a warre with Spaine, and then to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude it partly without, and partly again≈øt the approbati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Parliament, and ≈øo afterwards to France it ≈øelfe.</p>
            <p>To this may be added the taking of Rochell, for all the ayde of his Maie≈øties ≈øhips; the little a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance which of late times hath been from England af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:118555:7"/>
to the Netherlands, and from all their premi≈øes it may be concluded, that there were all de≈øtructive wayes to the Prote≈øtant Religion, and therefore promoted and pro≈øecuted by great per≈øons Popi≈øhly addicted to the ruine of our Peace, our Lives, Liberties, and (which is yet much dearer to us) our Religion. Was the plot ≈ømall may we think by billetting of ≈øouldiers in all parts of this Kingdome, by intending to bring in forraign forces, e≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially many hundred of German hor≈øe, and by propo≈øing Martiall law to be put into execution, which now we ≈øee to take effect, yet it was under pretence of law, when there was neither Rea≈øon, Law, nor Equity for the rai≈øing of forces or any ≈øuch great ≈øummes of mony as there was rai≈øed, which yet had they been imployed in any rea≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable proportion for the good of the King or Kingdome, neither King nor Kingdome had been ≈øo di≈øtre≈ø≈øed as now they are, but the truth is, as ≈øuch va≈øt ≈øummes were ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally extorted, ≈øo they were as fraudulentally di≈øpo≈øed without his Maie≈øties privity, even to the ≈øtrengthening of the profe≈ø≈øed enemies of our Religion, which now threaten the ≈øubjugation, if not the utter extirpation of it.</p>
            <p>The next plot was for bra≈ø≈øe mony, and the making of it currant, whil≈øt the French of all other nations were permitted to carry our gold and ≈øilver, away, were they of what Sexe, Age, or condition ≈øoever. How much the Queen Mother had for her part is not, nor ever will bee certainly knowne, but, it is conceived upon very good ground, that ≈øhe and her Ie≈øuiticall traine have had two millions of mony, which is tenne times as much, as the Queen her daughter brought into this land; and if this hath not been a heavie burthen to poore England, let all
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:118555:8"/>
men Iudge. But this is not all, have not the Ie≈øuites had free egre≈ø≈øe and regre≈ø≈øe and intimate acquaintance, with <hi>Canterbury, Wren,</hi> and the re≈øt of the Popi≈øh Bi≈øhops, whereby they procured the di≈øcountenancing, yea the ≈øuppres≈øing of the mo≈øt able and faithfull Divines and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øters of the Go≈øpell, when in the mean time who were advanced and put into places of tru≈øt or preferment, but Arminians, and Socinians, who≈øe poy≈øenous tenents in ≈øome and many things are ≈øteps to Rome, in others more dangerous as being more ≈øubtilly contrived.</p>
            <p>We cannot here omit (by their in≈øtigation) the recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving into favour of many great Delinquents who fled from the Iu≈øtice of the Parliament: the ce≈ø≈øation of Armes in Ireland to bring over the warre and Popery in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to England; the Queens negotiation beyond the Seas, for the continuance and fomenting this unnaturall warre, partly in her owne per≈øon, and partly by her ≈øeconds. And to this end the pawning of the Iewels of the Crowne. The ≈øeverall plots daily contrived to corrupt our ≈øoldiers, citizens, nay even our Divines them≈øelves, all which are unquiet and dangerous i≈ø≈øues and effects of the French and Spani≈øh Coun≈øells.</p>
            <p>And now (when they can proceed no further in their mi≈øchievous devices) they indeavoured to continue the la≈øt and wor≈øt of all, which is ≈øtill managed by the help of their old ≈øure freinds who are ≈øo gracious at Court, and that is the ≈øeparating of his Maie≈øty from his high Cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

of all other practices this is mo≈øt fearfull, de≈øtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctive, and the mo≈øt de≈øperate, for who could imagine (did it not evidently appeare) that the Papi≈øts both of the French and Spani≈øh faction ≈øhould have ≈øuch an influence on his Maje≈øty, as to make him beleive that his Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ≈øet again≈øt him and the good of the land, and that <hi>Privadoes</hi> and <hi>Sycophantes</hi> at Court are better affected and more able to ≈øeek for the good and ≈øafety of the King and Kingdome then they are, as if it were probable the wi≈ødome, and till now the never ≈øu≈øpected integrity of both the Hou≈øes of Parliament, by which the King and Kingdome have alwayes flouri≈øhed could ever prove ≈øo treacherous to King or Kingdome, or be ≈øo carele≈ø≈øe of them≈øelves and their po≈øterity as to doe things di≈øhone≈øt and trea≈øonable, or if it were po≈ø≈øible that men for the mo≈øt part who were never greatly intru≈øted by his Maie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty, or the State, ≈øhould bee able to give more faithfull Coun≈øell, or be le≈ø≈øe ≈øubiect to erroneous advices then they are, who now ≈øit in our high Court of Parliament.
